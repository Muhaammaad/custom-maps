Custom Maps makes it easy to create GPS maps from map images, and those maps can be used anywhere without data signal for your Android device.

Since Custom Maps does not require data signal it can be used while hiking in national and state parks that may be out of reach of data networks, or it can be used to avoid expensive data roaming charges abroad.

Because Custom Maps can convert any map images, including photos, to GPS maps, it can be used when visiting zoos and amusement parks which typically post large maps of the park layout at the entrance of the park. Just snap a photo of the posted map, line it up with Google Maps in the app, and you're ready to go.

Custom Maps is also useful for anyone who wants to create or share customized maps with others. Created maps can be shared using email from the app itself, or by hosting the map on a web server and posting QR codes for others to scan to trigger downloading of those maps.
